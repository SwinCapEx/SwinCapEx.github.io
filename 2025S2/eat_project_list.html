    <h3 class="project-title"> UG_EAT_01 FleetSight: A dive into the insights from vehicle statistics
        
        (ATC206)</h3>
  
    <div class="project-details" style="display: none;">
      <p><strong>Students:</strong> Matthew Falcke, Domenic Marulli, Maisha Mehedi,  SIYA, Michael Van Der Merwe</p>
      <p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Ali Yavari</p>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Harindu, Dean, Nadim, Chamod, SkyLedge</p>
        <p>FleetSight is a comprehensive research project that evolved from initially developing machine learning models to determine optimal tyre pressure into an extensive investigation of tyre sensor data and vehicle dynamics. The project conducted a deep dive into tyre sensor performance, analyzing factors affecting signal strength and connection reliability, identifying causes of over and under reporting in sensor readings, and examining consistency patterns in pressure data. A key focus involved developing methods to detect tyre or sensor changes based on data anomalies. Additionally, the project developed a separate vehicle load estimation algorithm that calculates payload distribution. </p>

        <p>Our project is based around modelling and designing an accumulator (a high voltage DC battery pack) for Team Swinburne's Formula SAE electric race car. The main reason that the accumulator is being overhauled is the current cells being used are an old design and the cells themselves are old, leading to poor performance with better options on the market. Our main goal was to select new cells for, model and design a new accumulator for the 2026 iteration of the vehicle.  </p>

        <p>This project, in collaboration with Thoughtworks, developed an interactive digital twin dashboard to visualize trends in technology adoption and team comfort levels across the organization. Using internal survey data, we built a scalable PostgreSQL database, generated realistic mock data, and created production-ready visualizations to support leadership decision-making. Despite limited documentation and delayed system access, we delivered a functional prototype that integrates seamlessly into the existing Thoughtworks dashboard. Key achievements included user-centric design, full-stack mock environment setup, and robust trend analysis tools, which helps provide a strategic solution for tracking team engagement with evolving technologies over time. </p>

    <h3 class="project-title"> UG_EAT_80 Practical Membership Inference Attacks and Efficient Defense in Generative Models
        
        (EN103)</h3>

        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Dr. Viet Vo, Swinburne University of Technology</p>
        <p>Knowing which data is used to train large language models is a critical challenge, posing privacy risks to data owners. Recent studies have shown that LLMs are vulnerable to membership inference attacks, which can reveal whether specific data was used to train models such as BERT, GPT, LLaMA, Geok-3, and DeepSeek. However, the practicality of such attacks and defenses remains unclear. For example, some attacks require multiple prompt queries to the server, making them easier to detect, while some defense solutions rely on heuristic thresholds to identify keywords. Furthermore, vision generative models have not been thoroughly investigated under such attacks and defenses. This project will explore new and efficient attack strategies leveraging backdoor attacks, as well as defense techniques using watermarking, malicious query detection, differential privacy, and cryptographic methods. </p>

      <p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Naveed Ali</p>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Sascha Hoinka, Swinburne University of Technology</p>
        <p>This project enhances a quantum gas experiment that heats dysprosium metal using Eurotherm PID controllers. Through TCP Modbus communication, we developed a Python Tkinter-based interface to manipulate the controllers, giving researchers greater control and visibility over the experiment. The UI enables real-time comparison of experimental and theoretical temperature data, data export, and scheduling of temperature segments, for example, automatically advancing to the next stage on a specified day and time. By combining hardware control with an intuitive, custom-built interface, the system streamlines experimental workflows and introduces new automation and analysis capabilities for precision temperature regulation in quantum research. </p>

        <p>BeSide- Safer Together is more than a safety app, it’s a movement to make every journey safe and trusted. Born from real fears of traveling alone, and from the growing reality that Melbourne no longer feels secure with rising assaults and street crimes making even daylight walks unsettling; BeSide transforms fear into empowerment. It’s a consent-driven safety app that connects verified users nearby to walk or travel together with confidence. With live GPS tracking, ID verification, and instant emergency alerts, BeSide builds safety through mutual trust. It’s not just technology; it’s hope, connection, and protection in one. BeSide- safer together, always. </p>
