        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Jimmy ho, Universal Biosensors</p>
        <p>This project designs an automated Pressure Decay Testing (PDT) system to improve leak detection in pharmaceutical and biosensing vials. Current manual and semi-automated methods lack accuracy, repeatability, and scalability. Guided by standards and literature, the work produces a SolidWorks CAD design validated with MATLAB and ANSYS simulations, including material selection. The key question is how automation boosts reliability and throughput. Objectives cover requirements definition, risk analysis, and simulation-based validation. Preliminary results show feasibility and effectiveness, underscoring strong industrial relevance and the potential to advance automated quality control. </p>

        <p>"Accurate short-term solar power forecasting is crucial for efficient grid management and renewable energy integration. Photovoltaic generation is inherently intermittent and
influenced by weather conditions, posing challenges for reliable prediction. In this study, we systematically evaluate multiple temporal encoding schemes (traditional, sinusoidal, and cyclic) and model architectures, including CNNs, transformer-based models, hybrid CNN-LSTM approaches, and LSTM networks. Experiments on the UniSolar dataset demonstrate that cyclic temporal encoding combined with an LSTM-based model achieves superior predictive performance, capturing both short- and long-term temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Time-of-day analysis highlights robust performance across different periods, particularly during rapid changes in solar generation. Our results provide practical insights into model selection and temporal feature engineering for solar power forecasting." </p>

A computational model of a regular motorcycle helmet was developed as a control model, as well as the novel airbag helmet which integrates the airbag with the traditional motorcycle helmet. These motorcycle helmets were subjected to numerical simulations in LS-DYNA which replicate those of the Australian Standards. Additionally, an experiment was undertaken using a drop test facility to compare a regular EPS bicycle helmet and a novel proof of concept of an airbag helmet, using bicycle helmets with inflatable objects secured to the helmets, also replicating Australian Standard testing.

        <p>This project presents the integrated mechanical and electrical design of an electric vehicle platform for multi energy power source testing. It includes a 2400×900×450 mm3 tubular steel chassis (35×35 mm2), independent suspension, rack and pinion steering, and a complete electrical system with a 51.2V 100Ah LiFePO₄ battery, 5 kW BLDC motor, and safety compliant harness. FEA under 1960 N showed 101.9 MPa max von Mises stress, FoS 2.775, and 3.856 mm displacement. The dual circuit 48V/12V architecture (DC DC) follows ISO 26262 and SAE J1673. A 5.2 m modular harness enables future fuel cell integration. A key limitation is,  the multi energy integration architecture is not well defined. </p>

        <p>RunLab is a markerless running form analysis system that uses computer vision and machine learning to provide real time feedback for runners. By extracting 2D pose landmarks with MediaPipe and computing key biomechanical metrics like cadence, trunk lean, and overstride, the system classifies form quality and delivers clear coaching tips through a website interface. It bridges the gap between costly motion capture labs and accessible, data driven training for everyday runners. </p>
