        <p>The Virtual Psychologist project harnesses Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to create an accessible and personalized mental health support system. Using natural language processing, it engages users in real-time conversations offering tailored therapeutic assistance. The system bridges mental health service gaps, especially for remote or underserved communities, by providing 24/7 support. Incorporating evidence-based methods like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), it ensures ethical standards through secure data handling and privacy protection. While not a replacement for professional therapists, it complements traditional care, demonstrating GenAI’s potential to enhance accessibility, personalization, and overall mental well-being. </p>

        <p>Our project develops a computer vision-based hazard awareness solution for Australian garbage trucks, eliminating the need for costly dual-control systems. We utilise a fine-tuned YOLO model for inference, deployed on an NVIDIA AGX Orin, where the solution processes real-time data from a RealSense depth camera to detect and annotate nearby obstacles. The solution is to be deployed on a small touchscreen display in the driver cabin, where the drivers can observe the real-time visibility of the left-hand side of the truck where the bins are located, also providing the driver with a gripper alignment indicator.  This significantly reduces operational costs, whilst maintaining integrity with safety standards for waste collection vehicles.  </p>

        <p><strong>Client:</strong> , Digital Village</p>
        <p>The client has identified a critical need to centralise the rapidly growing body of AI/ML research  into a single, accessible, and well-curated digital compendium. Currently, internal stakeholders— referred to as ‘guild members’—face difficulties in efficiently locating and leveraging the most  relevant insights for innovation, decision-making, and dissemination across teams. Without a  centralised repository, valuable research is fragmented, hard to access, and often underutilised. This project aims to address that gap by delivering a structured AI-powered web scraping tool. The purpose of the scraper is to scrape the web for validated and contextually relevant  research that remains useful over time. By incorporating metadata tagging and JSON structuring,  the scraper will allow for intuitive access and seamless integration with other systems or  workflows within the client organisation.  </p>

        <p>Our project is an educational web-based logistics simulation tool with modules such as the Shortest Path Problem (SPP), Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), Travelling Salesman Problem(TSP),Transportation Problem (TP), and Multi-Modal Transportation Optimization (MTO). It helps users understand how optimization works by allowing them to generate algorithm-based routes, create custom routes, and compare their efficiency. The system displays route distances, vehicle paths, and optimization suggestions. We built it using React and Mapbox to make learning logistics concepts interactive, visual, and practical. </p>

        <p>Our project, Developing an AI Chatbot for Clinical Psychology Training, creates a realistic virtual patient simulator for psychology students. Using large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning, the system allows trainees to practice therapy sessions with AI-driven patients exhibiting various psychological conditions, including depression and suicidal ideation. The chatbot adapts its tone, emotion, and responses dynamically, providing authentic interactions and post-session feedback summaries. Built with a React frontend, Flask backend, and MongoDB Atlas database, it offers both text and voice-based communication bridging theory and practical training in mental health education through safe, repeatable, AI-guided simulations. </p>

        <p>This project aims to provide safety, peace of mind, and stored proof for at-risk individuals, especially children and the elderly, through multi-device logging and automated threat analysis via audio recording with triggers and actions upon threat detection. The system would collect audio and optionally video, coordinated across multiple devices such as mobile phones. This data would be analysed using an AI model, which detects threats so the system can automatically alert the individuals involved, the emergency contacts, permitted stakeholders, or potentially authorities in the future. </p>

        <p>KG LLM main goal is to preserve cultural fishing knowledge that is easily lost with time. The project applies world's latest technology, LLMs and AI, to automate the extraction of key fishing knowledge from fisherfolks using publicly available research papers on the topic. The knowledge is then presented on a knowledge graph with nodes for objects and edges for representing the relationships between those objects. This way of preserving the fishing knowledge not only ensures that key cultural techniques are protected but also enhances the way that information is shown to fishing communities as well as people from around the world.  </p>

        <p>The annotation tool project is a tool that leverages AI to analyse and annotate student writing and provide meaningful annotates on key writing skills. It takes advantage of the full Microsoft Azure suite of resources to function and utilises Azure's AI Foundry for the tool to identify various elements such as writing techniques, vocabulary and sentence structure. The backend processes text and returns the annotations as structured JSON annotations which are stored in the Azure SQL database. Other key resources integrated within the project include Azure App Container, Azure Functions, and GitHub Actions. </p>
