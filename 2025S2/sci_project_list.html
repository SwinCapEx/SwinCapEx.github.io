    <h3 class="project-title"> UG_SCI_01 Targeted Differentiation of Pluripotent Stem Cells via Gene Delivery Using Baculovirus and AAVS1 Insertion
        
        (EN203)</h3>

        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Swinburne University of Technology</p>
        <p>Human pluripotent stem cells (hESCs and iPSCs) can differentiate into any cell type, but guiding this process reliably and efficiently requires precise genetic control. Transcription factors (TFs) that drive lineage-specific programs can be introduced into hPSCs to induce differentiation into specific fates. To enable precise and efficient differentiation, the project will explore baculovirus-mediated transient expression by delivering lineage-specific transcription factors using this, the project aims to model and optimise protocols for generating each cell type. Ultimately, this work contributes to the development of advanced co-culture systems and engineered tissue constructs for studying.  </p>

        <p>Our project looked into the cis and trans isomers of Acet-NBA which is a sustainable aviation fuel candidate to replace current commercial aviation fossil fuels. Acet-NBA shares a very similar base structure to JP-10 which is a highly effective fuel for military aviation purposes. This was done computationally in Gaussian16 to determine which isomer was more stable, whilst also investigating the stability of each combustion radical. These calculations were done at the DFT theory level to ensure that all calculations could be completed within this research project’s short timeframe, while providing accurate results that can be used in comparison to literature to determine Acet-NBA’s viability as a sustainable aviation fuel. </p>

        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing, Swinburne University of Technology</p>
        <p>Using the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope, a sample of galaxies with low star formation rates (SFRs) are observed in order to search for evidence of galactic outflows. Outflows are streams of heated and accelerated gas ejected from galaxies as a result of active galactic nuclei and high star forming regions, driven out by supernovae (SNe). Sub SFR galaxies lack the sufficient star formation to generate SNe and subsequent reactions. Therefore, analysing structures which resemble outflows, such as superbubbles or long filaments, could indicate the presence of Type Ia SNe in inactive star forming galaxies, to analyse the contributing effects on outflow. </p>

      <p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Rohan Shah</p>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> , Swinburne University of Technology</p>
        <p>In this study, the goal is to create and decorate stearic acid based Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN). A PEG-chitosan polymer conjugate will be used to coat the SLN to add further sensitivity to temperature and pH to the carrier SLN. We will be producing these SLN using a combination of Microwave-assisted microemulsion, where the lipid and aqueous phases are heated and injected into cold water. The rapid crystallisation of the lipid will then produce SLN. As a result, we should be able to generate SLN suitable for drug delivery, that will respond to physical changes. This has potential to aid the treatment of infections, such as those induced in wound healing. </p>

    <h3 class="project-title"> UG_SCI_07 Antioxidant Potential in Rice: DPPH vs HPLC

      <p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Peter Mahon</p>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Swinburne University of Technology</p>
        <p>This project investigates the antioxidant potential of different rice varieties, comparing pigmented (red and black) and non-pigmented (white and brown) samples. Antioxidants protect the body from oxidative stress, which is linked to aging and many diseases.  Rice extracts were prepared using  solvent extraction and analysed using two complementary approaches: the DPPH  assay and HPLC-CUPRAC method. Ideally DPPH should show the overall antioxidant activity, while HPLC-CUPRAC identifies which specific compounds were responsible. The results suggest that darker, pigmented rice varieties have stronger antioxidant power, highlighting how rice colour relates to its potential health benefits. </p>

        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Swinburne University of Technology</p>
        <p>The increasing prevalence of oral diseases caused by bacterial infections, particularly antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, highlights an urgent need for alternative antimicrobial strategies. Endophytic fungi from Australian Eucalyptus species represent a promising source of novel bioactive compounds due to their ability to produce diverse secondary metabolites with antibacterial potential. This study aimed to characterise fungal endophytes EC 02 (Eucalyptus citriodora) and EG 06 (Eucalyptus globulus) and evaluate the antimicrobial activity of their solvent extracts and biosynthesised silver nanoparticles against oral pathogens. The findings contribute to developing sustainable, endophyte-derived therapeutics to address antimicrobial resistance in oral cavity infections. </p>

      <p><strong>Students:</strong> Finn Bennet, Binaya Kaluthotage</p>
      <p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Francois Malherbe</p>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Swinburne University of Technology</p>
        <p>Our project explores the sustainable recycling of waste oyster shells as an eco-friendly source of biominerals for biomedical applications. Every year, millions of tonnes of shells end up in landfills, yet they are composed primarily of calcium carbonate and discarded shells can be converted into valuable compounds such as calcium oxide and hydroxyapatite that can be widely used in dental products, bone grafts and medical equipment. We tested and iterated on an eco-friendly, low- temperature hydrothermal method to transform the crushed oyster shells into hydroxyapatite, reducing reliance on mined limestone and diverting marine waste from landfills. This project demonstrates how circular economy principles can turn shell waste into valuable and sustainable materials for environmental and healthcare applications </p>

      <p><strong>Students:</strong> Patrick Neale, Rakim Mhlanga, Jessi Leftis</p>

        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Centre for Surface Engineering for Advanced Materials (SEAM), Swinburne University of Technology</p>
        <p>This project focused on developing a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based electrochemical sensor for the direct and selective detection of p-synephrine, a stimulant compound commonly found in dietary supplements. MIPs were fabricated on graphite screen-printed electrodes, enabling selective recognition of p-synephrine through its distinctive electrochemical signature without the need for external redox probes. The optimised MIP demonstrated enhanced sensitivity and selectivity compared to non-imprinted controls. This study highlights the potential of MIP-based electrochemical sensing as a basis for future development of selective, low-cost analytical tools with applications in sports doping monitoring and broader molecular detection.  </p>

        <p>Our project is a collaboration with mDetect, an industry partner specialised in muon detection. The aim of our project is to determine if mDetect's portable, modular detectors are precise enough to resolve changes in muon flux spacially above the detector; i.e. from a less dense portion of the ceiling. Should these particular detectors be capable of differentiating small changes in muon flux, a python script is used to display these changes in a heatmap, and thus creating a psueodo-density scanner of the rooms above. </p>
