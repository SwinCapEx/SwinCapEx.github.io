        <p>Most fleet managers struggle to monitor the amount of emissions their fleet produces in real time. This project (Emipliance) addresses this issue by providing emission visualisation insights for each truck measured according to Euro standards and the ability to download custom emission reports. This will allow fleet managers to identify any inefficiencies in their fleet operations, enabling fleet operators to improve fuel efficiency and reduce operational costs. </p>

        <p><strong>Client:</strong> John Joyner, MP Outcomes</p>
        <p>BeSide- Safer Together is more than a safety app, it’s a movement to make every journey safe and trusted. Born from real fears of traveling alone, and from the growing reality that Melbourne no longer feels secure with rising assaults and street crimes making even daylight walks unsettling; BeSide transforms fear into empowerment. It’s a consent-driven safety app that connects verified users nearby to walk or travel together with confidence. With live GPS tracking, ID verification, and instant emergency alerts, BeSide builds safety through mutual trust. It’s not just technology; it’s hope, connection, and protection in one. BeSide- safer together, always. </p>

        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Chris Ludlow, Armita Zarnegar, Swinburne University of Technology</p>
        <p>Our project, Developing an AI Chatbot for Clinical Psychology Training, creates a realistic virtual patient simulator for psychology students. Using large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning, the system allows trainees to practice therapy sessions with AI-driven patients exhibiting various psychological conditions, including depression and suicidal ideation. The chatbot adapts its tone, emotion, and responses dynamically, providing authentic interactions and post-session feedback summaries. Built with a React frontend, Flask backend, and MongoDB Atlas database, it offers both text and voice-based communication bridging theory and practical training in mental health education through safe, repeatable, AI-guided simulations. </p>

        <p>Feed the Dungeon is a Dungeon-Crawler, and Hack-and-Slash game, starring the Raccoon Cook, Chef, whose ferocious appetite leads them deep within the Dungeon.   
Feed the Dungeon aims to give players a semi-cosy experience as they venture through a dungeon, slaying monsters and bosses and cooking them into meals to gain buffs. Combat is the core of this game but it revolves around the buffs you pick from your meals. 
The atmosphere is a fantastical and whimsy adventure set inside a rundown dungeon that has been taken over by all manner of monsters. 
Venture forth brave Chef, eat, work, slay, repeat! </p>

      <p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Bita Zaferanloo</p>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Swinburne University of Technology</p>
        <p>The increasing prevalence of oral diseases caused by bacterial infections, particularly antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, highlights an urgent need for alternative antimicrobial strategies. Endophytic fungi from Australian Eucalyptus species represent a promising source of novel bioactive compounds due to their ability to produce diverse secondary metabolites with antibacterial potential. This study aimed to characterise fungal endophytes EC 02 (Eucalyptus citriodora) and EG 06 (Eucalyptus globulus) and evaluate the antimicrobial activity of their solvent extracts and biosynthesised silver nanoparticles against oral pathogens. The findings contribute to developing sustainable, endophyte-derived therapeutics to address antimicrobial resistance in oral cavity infections. </p>
