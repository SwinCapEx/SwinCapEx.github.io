        <p>BeSide- Safer Together is more than a safety app, it’s a movement to make every journey safe and trusted. Born from real fears of traveling alone, and from the growing reality that Melbourne no longer feels secure with rising assaults and street crimes making even daylight walks unsettling; BeSide transforms fear into empowerment. It’s a consent-driven safety app that connects verified users nearby to walk or travel together with confidence. With live GPS tracking, ID verification, and instant emergency alerts, BeSide builds safety through mutual trust. It’s not just technology; it’s hope, connection, and protection in one. BeSide- safer together, always. </p>
